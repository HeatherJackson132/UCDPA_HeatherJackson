**Dataset**

I scraped my dataset from VGChartz.com. The dataset is the most extensive one that I could find online and as of 2018, the no longer produce estimates for sales but rather record sale data where the data is made available by developers and publishers. I used another github project as a basis for how I scraped the data however I modified it to include genre â€“ this was done by creating a file for each genre then amalgamating all of them. I also got a Steam dataset from Kaggle to confirm which games were on Steam and which were not for PC/Mac.

These datasets were chosen due to their size and accuracy.
